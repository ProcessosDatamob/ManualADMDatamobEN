# DASHBOARD

The purpose of this system screen is to enable the user to view and analyze the various consumption and usage data collected from the devices. All this data will be detailed in this section.

To find out how to access and analyze the data displayed on the Dashboard, follow the steps described in this section.

The Dashboard screen can be considered the "Home Screen" of the system, as it is displayed as soon as you access the Portal, but it can also be accessed by clicking on the "Dashboard" menu. On first access, the user, device and consumption indicators will not yet have any information, so they will be set to zero.

When you access the screen, all the information will be displayed separated into sections. Each section corresponds to a different piece of data collected from the device and all the information is displayed according to the options selected in the filter (Company, Group or User). In all the sections, there will be icons indicating whether the graphs include information from Android and iOS or just one of them

By enabling the "**International Roaming**" filter option in the top right-hand corner of the screen, the system will only display information collected when the devices are using a roaming connection.

The "Company", "Group" and "User" filters allow you to analyze data from devices at a specific level.

Click on the "**Company**" filter, type in and select the company name to display the information collected from all devices.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Total Users <a href="#id-2jxsxqh" id="id-2jxsxqh"></a>

This indicator displays the total number of device users using the **Datamob Enterprise** application.

### Total Licenses <a href="#id-3awqvm692ar0" id="id-3awqvm692ar0"></a>

This indicator shows the total number of licenses on the portal. In other words, the licenses available and used.

When you click on this indicator, the system will display the "Contracted licenses" screen. To find out how to use this screen, read the "**Contracted licenses**" section.

### Licenses not installed on portal <a href="#z337ya" id="z337ya"></a>

This indicator shows the total number of licenses that do not have a device registered on the portal. In other words, these are the licenses available.

When you click on this indicator, the system will display the "Contracted licenses" screen with the Registered device filter set to No. To find out how to use this screen, read the "**Contracted licenses**" section.

### Devices <a href="#id-2xcytpi" id="id-2xcytpi"></a>

This indicator displays the total number of devices that are active in the system and the devices without communication. It also allows the administrator to see which devices are in Kiosk Mode.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **TOTAL -** These devices are considered "Active" when installing and activating the **Datamob Enterprise** application.

By clicking on "Total" the indicator will display the "Device List" screen containing the report with the main information on active devices.

* **NO COMMUNICATION** - This indicator displays the total number of devices that have not been sending data to the servers for an extended period. When you click on "No Communication", the system displays the screen of devices without communication.

Communication is the synchronization of information that the device has captured and that is sent to the portal. This lack of communication can occur when the device is in the following situations:

* Turned off;
* No internet connection;
* Uninstalled application.

The time calculation to consider a device as out of communication is the sync time configured for the company + 10 minutes.

If the device stops sending general usage/device information for a time exceeding the defined sync interval + 10 minutes, its status changes to "No Communication." To restore communication, the administrator can send a message with the START\_SERVICES command through the Messages menu in the portal.

Clicking on the No Communication indicator will display a screen with a report of the devices that are out of communication.

### **Mobile Data Usage**

This indicator displays the percentage of the devices' mobile data consumption during the cycle in relation to the total limit configured in the Consumption Profile. If no limit is configured in the Consumption Profile, the graph will not display the percentage, and the system will only display the total amount of data in MB used.

### SMS Consumption <a href="#id-3whwml4" id="id-3whwml4"></a>

This indicator displays the percentage of SMS consumption sent by devices during the cycle in relation to the total limit configured in the Consumption Profile. If no limit is configured in the Consumption Profile, the graph will not display the percentage, but only the total amount of SMS used.
