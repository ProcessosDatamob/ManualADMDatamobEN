# USERS

All system users can be classified into three types: Company Administrator, Group Administrator and Device User. To find out how to manage each of them, just go to the sections on "[**Managing administrator users**](gerenciar-usuarios-administradores.md)", "[**Registering a new administrator**](cadastrar-novo-usuario-administrador.md)" and "[**List of devices**](../dispositivos/list-of-devices/)" in this manual.&#x20;

The characteristics of the different types of users of the system are described in the following subsections.

### Company Administrator <a href="#id-28h4qwu" id="id-28h4qwu"></a>

When the company is created, the system creates the first company administrator user and, together with the password, sends it to your contact e-mail address. However, other company administrator users can be created after accessing the Portal. This type of user will have all the privileges and access in the Company Portal, being able to create and delete policies and create and change other users.

### Group Administrator <a href="#nmf14n" id="nmf14n"></a>

This type of user will only be able to view and change the members and information of the group they manage.

### Device Users <a href="#id-37m2jsg" id="id-37m2jsg"></a>

These users will be created during the process of activating the **Datamob Enterprise** application on the device. Once the application has been activated, you can view this user's information in the Portal.
