# ZERO TOUCH

Zero Touch enrollment is a simplified process for Android devices to be provisioned for enterprise management. The device starts the fully managed device provisioning method and downloads the associated **Datamob Enterprise** app, which completes the device configuration.

This deployment method is perfect for corporate Android devices, making large-scale deployments quick, easy and secure. Zero Touch simplifies online device configuration and shipping with enhanced management so that employees can open the box and get started.

To use Zero Touch enrollment, you'll need devices compatible with Android 8.0 or higher. In addition, all devices with Android 9 and above are compatible with Zero Touch.
