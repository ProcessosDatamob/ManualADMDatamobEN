2. Select the desired management:

* **Cycle start** - We use this field to define the start date for the accounting of the data to be analyzed;
* **Synchronize every** - This field defines the portal's synchronization time, i.e. the time to synchronize with the data received from the devices;
* **Warning Email** - This setting enables an email notification to be sent to the administrator when the device reaches 80%, 90% and 100% of the configured consumption profile;
* **Two-Factor Authentication** - This setting allows you to enable two-factor authentication on the **Datamob Enterprise** Administration Portal. After enabling this setting, whenever attempting to access the Portal, the user will need to provide a confirmation code that will be sent to their email.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**

Before enabling this setting, ensure that all users are registered with a valid email.
{% endhint %}

* **Inactivity Timeou**t - the system uses 30 minutes as the default, which can be reduced to as little as 5 minutes. After exceeding the defined time limit without performing any activity on the portal, the system will automatically log the user out and display a message informing that the session has expired.
