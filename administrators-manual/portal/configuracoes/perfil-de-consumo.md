The limits can be set to:

* Data - Sets the maximum consumption of mobile data;&#x20;
* SMS - Sets maximum SMS message consumption;&#x20;
* SMS Roaming - Sets maximum SMS message consumption when the device is roaming;&#x20;
* Data Roaming - Sets the maximum consumption of mobile data when the device is roaming;

1. Select one of the options and check "Unlimited" if you don't need to keep track of the percentage consumed. The consumption graphs will then not be generated, as there is no limit.
2. To set the "Data" or "Roaming Data" consumption limit, select the "Assigned consumption" option and specify the value in Bytes, KBytes, Mega Bytes or Giga Bytes.
3. To set the "SMS" or "SMS Roaming" consumption limit, select the "Assigned consumption" option and specify the number of messages.
4. After setting the limits, click on the "Update" button to complete and save the configuration.
