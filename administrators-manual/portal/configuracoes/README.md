# SETTINGS

The settings menu gives you access to the settings for consumption profiles and device management policies.

A policy defines a set of settings that can be applied to a device or a set of devices. Changes to a policy's settings will automatically update all devices linked to that policy.

A policy can be applied to a device during registration or afterwards. There are no limitations on the number of policies created in the system.

The settings menu options are:

* **Manage Policies** - lists all the policies already registered and allows you to search, edit, copy, generate a report, remove and generate a token for device activation.
* **Register new policy** - allows you to create a new policy and all its settings.
* **Consumption Profile** - allows you to register the consumption profile for the company, group and user.
* **iOS Registration Policy** - allows you to update an iOS policy.
* **Manage Wi-Fi Networks** - allows you to register Wi-Fi networks that will later be used in the Policy Settings;
