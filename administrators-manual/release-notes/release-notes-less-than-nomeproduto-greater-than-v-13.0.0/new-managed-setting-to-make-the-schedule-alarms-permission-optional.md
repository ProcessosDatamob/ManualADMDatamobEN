# New Managed Setting to make the Schedule Alarms Permission Optional

It is now possible to configure the "Schedule Alarms" permission as optional in the Managed Settings, allowing the application to be activated without the need to grant this permission. If the user does not enable this permission, the application will not perform the following functionalities: notification of received messages and documents, remote app installation, device geolocation logging, and SIM lock removal.
